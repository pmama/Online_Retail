# Online_Retail
This is a project of Data Mining with Association Rules and the powerful Apriori algorithm!  I have used the 'Online Retail' Dataset, uncovering hidden patterns and insights into customer behavior.

## Apriori algorithm is used to discover interesting hidden relationships in the large dataset. These relationships are usually represented in the form of "rules" or "association rules".



🛒 The dataset comprises diverse transactions from various countries and shopping trends.  After performing detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I delved into specific country-wise analyses 🌍 for the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain.

📊 My journey involved discovering associations rules between items frequently purchased together and uncovering valuable insights to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer experiences. 🛍️

📈A particularly noteworthy finding emerged through the Association Rules analysis. The presence of high lift values with low support, coupled with a confidence of 100%, suggests the occurrence of strong associations among specific items in the transaction data.

I'm excited about the implications of this project for businesses seeking to optimize their strategies and create tailored experiences for customers.
